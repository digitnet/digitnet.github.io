<div style="text-align: justify"> M4JPEG project aims to build and develop a Matlab-compiled steganography tool working in the field of JPEG images. The provided M4JPEG tool lets the user hide a private file within a JPEG image using an adaptive steganographic method called Mod4. The installation of Matlab IDE is not required before running M4JPEG. Thus, the user doesn't need to be a Matlab expert since M4JPEG is a standalone piece of software. Running the software just needs the installation of the Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR), which will be installed automatically by the installer of M4JPEG. The provided tool can be installed easily and has friendly graphical user interfaces. </div>
