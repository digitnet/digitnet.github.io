<div style="text-align: justify"> Steganography is a data hiding technique that has been used in the applications of information protection. It transmits a secret message by hiding it into a cover object to create a hidden way of communication. Steganography has the same goal as cryptography since they aim to protect sensitive information. But they differ in the way of working; Cryptography converts the plain message into an unreadable encrypted message where the presence of the cryptography is not concealed, while steganography smuggles the message by embedding it into an innocent-looking object and thus creating an invisible communication channel. </div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify"> The techniques of steganography have been developed in the field of digital objects such as JPEG images, where we can make the JPEG image a container for a secret message by embedding the message Bits within it. The JPEG image will represent a hidden communication channel, where no one knows what it contains except the sender and intended receiver. </div>
